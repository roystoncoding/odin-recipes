    <p>Kunafa or (Knafeh) is an easy Middle Eastern dessert that is made with a delicious cream (Ashta) filling between two layers of crispy Kunafa (shredded dough). Drizzled with sweet syrup and topped with pistachio slices. It is delicious hot or cold.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Thin shredded filo dough</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>
        <li>Sugar, vanilla extract, lemon juice, water and glucose liquid</li>
        <li>Heavy cream, cornflour, vanilla extract, and a small amount of sugar because we will add syrup, and we don't want it to be too sweet. (for making the cream)

        </li>
        <li>I use slices of pistachio; however, you can use any variety of nuts you like for the topping</li>
    </ul>
